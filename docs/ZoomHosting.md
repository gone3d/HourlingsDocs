## Overview

The Hourlings Writers group uses a shared Gmail account and Zoom Pro subscription to facilitate online meetings. This document outlines the login process and getting started related account signin procedures for any member who wants to help out and be a zoom host. _This is all volunteer and not required to for participation in the Hourlings._

For anyone hosting the Zoom meeting if a regular host is not available, this guide explains how to access these accounts and manage your Zoom sessions. To get the passwords for each account, please contact Liz. And please do not share these account credentials with anyone, ever.

If you plan on ever hosting, please have all of the login steps completed before the meeting to avoid any problems eating into the meeting

### Account Information

- **Gmail Account**: hourlingswriters@gmail.com
- **Gmail Password**: _contact Liz (on facebook or ehayes@cox.net)_
- **Zoom Account**: hourlingswriters@gmail.com
- **Zoom Password**: _contact Liz (on facebook or ehayes@cox.net)_

## Gmail Login Instructions

The first time you try to sign in to Zoom with the hourlingswriters@gmail.com account, you may need to retrieve a one-time passcode from the Gmail account. There are two ways to do this:

1. Have a current admin/host aid you (preferred)
2. Login in to Chrome with the hourlings

### Get A Code From An Admin

Select a contact from the list [here](#contact-information-adminshost-list) and coordinate a time you will try to sign into Zoom. There is a 10 min window in which the code is active and in most cases, sign in should take no more than a few minutes.

### Login into Chrome as hourlingswriters@gmail.com

1. Go to [gmail.com](https://gmail.com)
2. Enter the email address: `hourlingswriters@gmail.com`
3. Enter the password: _contact Liz (on facebook or ehayes@cox.net)_
4. If prompted for verification, use the options provided to verify the account

Once logged into Gmail, you'll be able to access any one-time passcodes that Zoom sends for verification purposes. These passcodes typically arrive immediately but expire after 10 minutes.

_Note: When you receive security alerts about someone signing into the account, this is normal as multiple people use these shared credentials._

The Sunday writers' group meeting should be set up as a recurring meeting. This means:

- Anyone with the link can join

## Best Practices & Troubleshooting

### Login Security Alerts

- You may receive security alerts about logins from different locations
- This is normal for a shared account
- No action is required if you recognize the activity as group-related

### Managing Multiple Accounts

- If you're already logged into a personal Zoom account on your device, you may need to log out first
- To switch accounts:
  1. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
  2. Select "Sign Out"
  3. Then log in with the Hourlings credentials

### Testing Before Meetings

- Consider doing a "dry run" before important meetings
- Test features like screen sharing and recording
- Make sure you can access all necessary controls

### Hosting Responsibilities

- The first person to join the meeting typically serves as host
- If you're hosting, arrive 5-10 minutes early
- If you need to leave early, transfer host duties to another participant

### Connection Issues

If you're having trouble logging in:

1. Try clearing your browser cache
2. Ensure you're using the correct credentials
3. Check if the one-time passcode has expired (request a new one if needed)
4. Try using a different browser or the Zoom desktop application
